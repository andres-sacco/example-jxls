The idea behind this library is create Excel documents using a template that anyone can modify the format. For more information about this library and how you can use it check my [page](https://sacco-andres.medium.com/)

## Technologies
Here are some of technologies that I used to developed this example:
- JXLS
- Java-Faker

Java Faker is a library which provide a lot random values for most of the common parameters (names, address, countries, ssn numbers) so I used to generate random values to put in the reports.
